### Continuous Development

This integration is **under active development**.

**More features are being added all the time**, including additional sensors, diagnostics, and deeper Home Assistant automation support.

## Prerequisites 📋

- **Warning**: Home Assistant minimum version **2026.1.0**
- **Account**: your Navimow account can sign in to the official app (used for authorization)

## Installation 🛠️

This integration is not in the default HACS store. You must add it as a custom repository.

This integration will be installed as a custom repository in HACS:

1. HACS → Integrations → top-right menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Repository: `https://github.com/segwaynavimow/NavimowHA`
3. Category: Integration
4. Search for `Navimow` in HACS and install it
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → search `Navimow`

## Usage 🎮

See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/segwaynavimow/NavimowHA/wiki/Getting-Started).

Once the integration is set up, you can control and monitor your Navimow mower using Home Assistant! 🎉

After setup, you should see:

- A `lawn_mower` entity (start/pause/dock/resume)
- A battery `sensor`

## Troubleshooting 🔧

If you encounter any issues with the Navimow integration, please check the Home Assistant logs for error messages. You can also try the following steps:

- Ensure that your mower is connected to your home network and accessible from Home Assistant.
- Restart Home Assistant and check if the issue persists.
- Make sure you are not blocking network access to services in China (if applicable to your environment).
- If you are using DNS filtering/ad-blocking, try disabling it temporarily.

If the problem continues, please file an issue on GitHub and include relevant log snippets:

## Navimow SDK Library 📚

This fork vendors the `mower_sdk` package and the Paho MQTT client used to
communicate with Navimow mowers. That avoids Home Assistant trying to install
`navimow-sdk` from PyPI during startup,
which can fail in newer Home Assistant/Python environments when stale or malformed
package metadata is already present.
